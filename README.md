# Meetup-events
This repo contains all the info for our monthly meetup events. 

## Overview
### We run monthly meetups on the 2nd WEDNESDAY of each month.
- We usually host 20-30 minutes talks. Aiming for two speakers on each event.
- We also host Lightning Talks on those events.
- We are always looking for speakers. If you would like to give a talk on our meetup, make a PR on this repository and fill the Talk Template with the details.
- For Lightning talks, you can submit the talk-title and your name and email on this link.
