# Meetup-events
This repo contains all the info for our monthly meetup events. More details on talks subjects can be found [here](https://python.ie/talk-subjects/).

## Overview
### We run monthly meetups on the 2nd WEDNESDAY of each month.
- We usually host 20-30 minutes talks. Aiming for two speakers on each event.
- We also host 5-10 min Lightning Talks at those events.
- We are always looking for speakers! If you would like to give a talk on our meetup, submit your proposal [here](https://python.ie/meetups/).
- For Lightning talks submission, scroll down to the end of [this page](https://python.ie/meetups/) and submit your _proposal_ there.

##  Talk proposals
Unfortunately, we are not able to personally help you putting proposals together BUT we can help you with support and assistance. And algo give you some suggestions for topics to submit. Anything counts, any story of something you've built or researched. Anything, as long as it is Python-related.

### Topics
There are no rules on the themes for submission, but we do have suggestions instead. Among the topics that could be covered, are the following:
* Anything made with [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/).
* We also love [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) and [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) enthusiasts!
* [Interrogate](https://interrogate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Is a library that examines your code checking for doc strings on all methods. We eould love to hear your use-case.
